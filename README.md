A toDo list website made using vanilla javascript, css, html and compiled using webpack. 

Demonstrating my grasp of the Odin Project's teaching about working across multiple files using webpack and importing / exporting code.

Within this project I also worked on optimising the layout of the site for mobile layouts by using media queries, and experimented with using local storage so that user's input for tasks and projects persists on their computer despite refresh / shutdown.
